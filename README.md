# Decent Forum Vue UI.


Vue UI for Decent Forum / Decent-a-Forums 

This needs its sibling package, https://github.com/aokisok/decent-forum-api . 

To setup for dev, just clone both packages as sibling folders and everything should work fine including live-reload
on editing of either project.

With VsCode you can add both folders to a workspace. 


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
